# project-library (week 2)

A vanilla JS project getting dynamic content from arrays/objects for the 2nd week project in Technigo React/Redux skillup course.

## How it works
Th app displays all the books stored in an object. The user can display books fron any genre avalibale in the dropdown menue or can display all. The user can also sort the books based on new to old to old to new or 21 century books.
The user can search any book by name.

 ## The problem
 The project was to be solved alone.
 For me the Dom manupulation in javascript was new concept, so I spent some time in understading how to approach the problem and some with a solution.
