# project-library (week 2)

This week's project for the Technigo React/Redux skill-up course involved creating a vanilla JavaScript application that dynamically fetches content from arrays/objects. The main focus was on manipulating the DOM to display a collection of books and provide various interactive features.

## How it works
The application showcases a collection of books stored in an object. Users have the flexibility to filter books by genre using a dropdown menu or display all books. Additionally, they can sort the books based on criteria such as new to old, old to new, or specifically focus on 21st-century books. A search functionality allows users to find books by their names.

 ## The Challange
 The project was an individual effort, and a significant learning curve for me was grasping the concept of DOM manipulation in JavaScript. Taking the time to understand how to approach the problem and devising a solution proved crucial to overcoming this challenge.
 
 ## Technologies used
